## 🧐 About <a name = "about"></a>

Calculator CLI which has basic operations:
- add
- subtract 
- multiply 
- divide 
- cancel 
- exit
- abs (absolute value)
- neg (negate the value)
- sqrt (square root)
- sqr(raise to the power of 2)
- cubert (cube root) 
- cube (raise to the power of 3)
- repeat (previous n commands) as commands
So that we can do basic mathematics.

All commands / operations is case insensitive, and invalid operations would not be counted as historical input. 

## 🏁 Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running.

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo.

## 🔧 Running the tests <a name = "tests"></a>

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system.

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```
